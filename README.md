#DISCRETE MATHEMATICS PORTFOLIO
##WEEK 1 (January 20, 2015 Wednesday)
  * Today we start this course called Discrete Mathematics (DISMATH). It is about mathematical reasoning, combinatory analysis, discrete structures, algorithmic thinking, applications and modeling.
  * I've learned that this course is understanding low level knowledge which is closer to the machine knowledge of understanding commands.
  * Proposition was also elaborated and I've learned that proposition is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, **but not both**. (K. Rosen)
  * I've also learned that it is tricky to understand whether a statement is a proposition, so to easily check the statement it is better to ask if the statement is answerable by true or false.
  * I've also learned that, paradoxical statements are eliminated in DISMATH.
