#DISCRETE MATHEMATICS PORTFOLIO
##WEEK 1 (January 20, 2015 Wednesday)
  * Today we start this course called Discrete Mathematics (DISMATH). It is about mathematical reasoning, combinatory analysis, discrete structures, algorithmic thinking, applications and modeling.
  * I've learned that this course is understanding low level knowledge which is closer to the machine knowledge of understanding commands.
  * Proposition was also elaborated and I've learned that proposition is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, **but not both**. (K. Rosen)
  * I've also learned that it is tricky to understand whether a statement is a proposition, so to easily check the statement it is better to ask if the statement is answerable by true or false.
  * I've also learned that, paradoxical statements are eliminated in DISMATH.

  ##WEEK 2 Day 1 (January 25, 2016 Monday)

  * Today I've learned about Logical Connectives and Truth Tables.
  * We've discussed how to use Logical Operators and how to prove a logical expression with the help of the truth tables.

  | **LOGICAL SYMBOL** | **LOGICAL OPERATOR** | **SIMPLE TERM** | **FORMULA** |   **LOGICAL EQUATION**     |
  |:------------------:|:--------------------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|:----------------------------:|
  | ¬  |Negation|not|val(¬p)=1 - val(p)|¬p|
  |^|Conjunction|and|val (p ^ q) = min(val(p), val(q))|p^q|
  | v |Disjunction| or | val(p  v q) = max(val(p), val(q))|p v q|
  |⊕ |Exclusive Disjunction| xor | if val(p) not equal val(q) = 1 ,otherwise 0 | p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) |
  | → | Conditional | if then | if val(p) ≤ val(q) = 1, otherwise 0| p → q ≡  ¬p v q |
  |↔ | Biconditional | iff | if val(p) equals val(q) = 1, otherwise 0 | p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p) |

* I've learned that negation inverts a proposition.

##WEEK 2 Day 2 (January 27, 2016 Wednesday)

* Today we've discussed about Logic Laws and Logial Equivalences.
* I've learned about Identity LAw, Domination Law which states that Truth always dominates in disjunction (max) and False always dominates in Conjuction (min).
* Negation states that in *disjuction*, when a subject is paired by its negation then the result will always be **True** however, it is always **False** in *conjunction*.
* Indempotent Law says that when a statement is added or multiplied by itself, then the answer will always be itself.
* I've also learned that every logical laws except for ***De Morgan's Law and Absorption Law*** are all present in algebra.
* I've also learned that it is important to consider every laws to use or every steps to use in getting the correct result in evaluating or prooving of statements.
